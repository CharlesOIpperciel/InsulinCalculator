# Insuline Calculator

## Introduction
<p align="justify"> This Python script is an insulin calculator designed to assist in determining insulin dosage for diabetic patients based on their condition, weight, and prescribed injection regimen. It provides a summary of the patient's condition, calculates the insulin dosage, and generates a rapid table for reference. A Javascript equivalent is available on my website @CharlesOIpperciel.github.io for demonstration purposes.</p>
